## 📌 Project Title: ML Pipeline for Classification with ONNX Integration

### 🚀 Brief Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that takes raw data, cleans and processes it, extracts and selects features, builds multiple classification models, and exports the best-performing model to the ONNX format for production use. The pipeline explores Linear Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers—backed by robust validation metrics, interpretability visualizations, and ONNX-based deployment readiness.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

### 🔍 Data Preprocessing

* Handles missing values and outliers.
* Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and visualizations.

### 📊 Feature Engineering

* **PCA** and **Automatic Feature Selection** implemented.
* Custom feature transformations to improve model performance.

### 🤖 Model Building

* Multiple algorithms tested:

  * **Linear Regression**
  * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  * **Naive Bayes**
  * **Decision Tree**

* Evaluation metrics include:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  * ROC curves and Confusion Matrices
  * Precision-Recall Curves and Feature Importance

### 🧪 Model Validation

* Each model is evaluated using hold-out validation and visualization dashboards.
* Final model is exported using **ONNX** for cross-platform inference.

## 🔄 ONNX Integration

This project includes:

* ONNX model export using `skl2onnx`
* Model testing using `onnxruntime`
* Ensures compatibility for production deployment in any ONNX-supported runtime

```python
# Example: Load and run ONNX model
import onnxruntime as rt
sess = rt.InferenceSession("pipeline.onnx")
```

## 🥇 Why This Matters

This project doesn’t just stop at model accuracy-it completes the full production loop by exporting to ONNX, enabling deployment in C++, Java, .NET, or any platform that supports ONNX. It’s a clean, reproducible, and production-oriented ML workflow, ideal for real-world data science applications.
